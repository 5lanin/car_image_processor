      "GMC GMC Sierra 1500 Extended Cab Truck The third generation of the Sierra was introduced in 2006 as a 2007 model, and the light-duty trucks appeared on the market in 2006.With over a century of experience on the market, GMC Trucks already knew what its customers want from their pickup-trucks. Even though it couldn't beat the Ford in the sales figures, that didn't mean that there was something wrong with the way the vehicle was built. It was more like the way the vehicle was priced. The T900 platform offered better solutions and more powerful engines than its predecessor, the T800.Like its predecessor, the Sierra was available in a few body versions, starting with a chassis-cab and going up to the big crew-cab version. Its raked windshield at 57 degrees decreased the wind noise and the aerodynamic resistance, increasing the fuel-efficiency. To add a more dynamic appearance, the Sierra featured flared wheel-arches. For the Extended Cab version, it featured a pair of doors at the front and sway doors in the back. The bed in the back was available in three sizes of 5.75' (1752 mm), 6.5' (1981 mm), and 8' (2438 mm) on three different wheelbases.Inside, the GMC Sierra offered up to five seating positions, with enough room for the front occupants and decent sized for the rear ones. Like most of the pickup-trucks on the market, it offered a big dashboard, with a steering-column mounted gear-selector for the automatic transmission.The manufacturer offered the Sierra with a choice of four engines paired as standard to a 4-speed automatic gearbox. It was available either as a 2WD or 4WD. Fullsize Pickup GMC_Sierra_1500_Extended_Cab_20072013\n"
